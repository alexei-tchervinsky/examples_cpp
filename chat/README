Chat server on boost asio for chatroom client written in C 
by Andrew Herriot (https://github.com/aherriot/chatroom) 

chat_server.cpp is based on callback. Message processing is made in the 
instance of class 'chat_room'. The processing is centralized.

chat_server_spawn.cpp is based on stackful coroutines. 
Message processing is made in each instance of class 'session'. 
The processing is decentralized. 
Class 'chat_room' is used only to keep all instances of class 'session'.

For client.c, batch sending of public messages was added for stress 
testing. 

Stress test for callback server is succesful.

Stress test for coroutines server failed (closing sessions etc). The
reasons should be investigated.
